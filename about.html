<p>I'm from Houston, Texas and am a geologist with a passion for the outdoors and climbing. I attended the University of Houston, earning a degree in geochemistry. While geology is my main background, I found data science to be a fantastic addition to my skills as it gives me another means of exploring the world. </p>
